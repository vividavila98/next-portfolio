## Introduction 

Hello again! My name is Viviana, and I’m a Front-End Wed based in Los Angeles, CA. I graduated from UC San Diego where I studied Cognitive Science with a specialization in Design and Interaction.

During my time at school, I started to teach myself how to code, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From there, I just couldn’t get enough of web development. I honed in on my JavaScript skills and learned how to work with ReactJS during my internships. Since then, I have worked with some fun technologies, including React Native, NextJS, and Redux.

I started this blog for other junior developers who are like me: self-taught, without a CS degree, but with a desire to learn everything there is to do with web development. Navigating this industry can be intimidating, which is why I feel it is so important to help out others in this community. I still have SO much left to learn, but this is my way of contributing to a group that has given me so much already! 

I am still new to this industy, and I have a lot to learn, so if you see any mistakes or know of a better solution than one that I have shared, please gently let me know. :)
