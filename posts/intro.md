## Introduction 

Hello! My name is Viviana, and I'm a Front-End Developer based in Los Angeles, CA. I am super excited to have finally started this tech blog. I am using this blog to keep track of my progress as a developer and (hopefully) help other developers along the way. 

I am still new to this industy, and I have a lot to learn, so if you see any mistakes or know of a better solution than one that I have shared, please gently let me know. :D
