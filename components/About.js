        Hello again! My name is Viviana, and I'm currently looking for my next role as a 
        Front-End Developer. With my education in UX/UI design, I started to teach myself how to code in 2018. 
        Since then, I've had the opportunity of working at a <a className="company" href="https://www.juristerra.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legal services startup</a>, a <a className="company" href="https://wistly.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delivery service app startup</a>, 
        and a <a className="company" href="https://growthmed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing agency</a>. In each role, I valued setting goals for myself, being feedback-oriented, and having a growth mindset. 
        <br/>
